# Database Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
- **Error**: `SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 table users has no column named phone`
- **Cause**: The `users` table was missing several columns that were expected by the registration controller
- **Location**: Registration process at `/register` endpoint

## Root Cause Analysis
The `users` table was missing the following columns:
- `phone` (unique)
- `billing_address`
- `state`
- `city`
- `pincode`
- `role` (enum: seller, buyer, admin)
- `sex` (enum: male, female, other)
- `dob` (date)
- `profile_picture`
- `default_address`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Migration
- Created migration: `2025_10_08_091038_add_missing_columns_to_users_table.php`
- Added all missing columns with appropriate data types and constraints
- Applied migration successfully

### 2. Enhanced Registration Flow
- Updated registration controller to set `login_success` session flag
- Enhanced voice welcome functionality to trigger after registration
- Added gender-specific welcome messages

### 3. Login Flow Enhancement
- Updated login controller to also set `login_success` flag
- Ensures voice welcome works for both registration and login

   - `database/migrations/2025_10_08_091038_add_missing_columns_to_users_table.php`
